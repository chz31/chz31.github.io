I was the teaching assistant for [Dr Matthew Liebold](http://www.leiboldlab.com/) for principles of graduate training course(ZOO6927-291D).
This is a training course for incoming first year biology graduate students. The course provides training for writing NSF style research proposal. 

In addition to providing training, there is open discussion on  academic issues such as authorship,plagarism, instigating research collaborations, giving talks at conference, outreach, non academic science careers and reproducibility and open data model.

We also orgnanized a field trip to [Seahorse Key Marine lab](https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/seahorse-key-marine-laboratory/)

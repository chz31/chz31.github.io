I am a postdoc at Dr. Murat Maga's lab at the Center of Developmental Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute. I received my PhD in the field of paleoanthropology, from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh (Advisor: Dr. Jeffrey Schwarts). I am currently involved in developing software modules within the open-source SlicerMorph extension in 3D Slicer for biological shape analysis, acquiring and processing 3D data for biological analysis, and maintaining the software extensions. I also plan to use these tools for studying craniofacial development, genetics, morphology, and evolution using the labratory mouse models.

My research interets include craniofacial biology and evolution (especially in humans and fossil hominids), paleoanthropology, evolutionary theories, biological shape analysis, 3D imaging and modeling, and statistical analysis.
